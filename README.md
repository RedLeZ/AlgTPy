AlgTPy is a translator that converts **Tunisian High School Algorithmic Language (Algo)** into **Python code**.  
It was created as a learning tool to help students quickly test, debug, and run their algorithm exercises without having to manually rewrite them in Python.

---

## ✨ Why This Project?
In Tunisian high schools, Informatics students are taught using a **paper-based algorithmic language** (keywords like `lire`, `ecrire`, `si`, `tantque`, etc.).  

This has two major issues:
- Students cannot run their code directly — they only write pseudocode on paper.  
- Debugging and testing logic becomes very difficult without execution.  

AlgTPy was made to solve this by **bridging Algo → Python**, so students can:
- Run their exercises on a real computer.  
- Test logic, loops, and conditions.  
- Learn Python naturally by comparing both languages.  

---

## 🚧 Current Status
This is an **early alpha (0.1a)** release.  

Currently supported:
- ✅ Variable declaration and assignment  
- ✅ Input (`lire`) with type detection (`entier`, `réel`, `booléen`, `chaine`)  
- ✅ Output (`ecrire`) → Python `print()`  
- ✅ If / ElseIf / Else statements  
- ✅ While loops (`tantque ... faire ... finTantque`)  
- ✅ For loops (`pour ... à ... pas ... finPour`)  
- ✅ Expressions: arithmetic, boolean, comparisons  

---

## 🛠 Planned Features
- ⏳ Functions / Procedures  
- ⏳ Arrays & matrices  
- ⏳ File handling  
- ⏳ Better error messages when translation fails  
- ⏳ A small CLI tool for easier usage  

---

## 📦 Usage (dev version)

```bash
python3 main.py -o output.py tests/example.algo
````

* `tests/example.algo` → input file in Algo language
* `output.py` → generated Python file

---

## 🧪 Example

Algo input:

```algo
i <- 0
tantque i < 5 faire
    ecrire(i)
    i <- i + 1
finTantque
```

Generated Python:

```python
i = 0
while (i < 5):
    print(i)
    i = (i + 1)
```
